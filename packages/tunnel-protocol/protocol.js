 * image limit after base64 expansion), and a single frame that large would
 * force both peers to hold the whole request in memory at once.
 *
 * Stream ids are allocated by the gateway and are unique per tunnel, never
 * across tunnels; a sandbox may not invent one.

 * list, so a declared `trustedHosts` authority cannot reach them and only a
