     * How long the arc takes to reach a new reading.

     * Short, and nothing to do with how often readings arrive. Pacing it to the
     * sampler's five seconds was the previous attempt and it was worse than
     * either thing it was trying to balance: an arc interpolating across the
     * whole interval is never showing the current reading, only travelling
     * towards it, so the ring disagreed with the number under the pointer for
     * seconds at a time. That is the lag, and no amount of smoothness pays for
     * it.
     *
     * Parking between readings is not a fault to design around. The value
     * genuinely does not change between samples, and a still arc says so.
     *
     * Declared HERE, above the stylesheet, because `STYLE` interpolates it at
     * module scope. Further down it was in the temporal dead zone by the time
     * that template ran, and the plugin failed to import at all.
