/**
 * The sandbox adaptation layer, host half.
 *
 * dsh is built for a host on the desk of the person using it. The browser and
 * the backend share a filesystem there, so a path is enough: a file the person
 * wants to talk about is already reachable, a produced file opens in whatever
 * the desktop associates with it, and the configuration document opens in an
 * editor. None of that holds when the backend runs in a sandbox — and the
 * harness has a signal that says so, `settings.canOpenAgentPresetDirectory()`, which is
 * already false on a Linux container with no display server.
 *
 * This plugin supplies what that signal reports missing, instead of hiding the
 * controls that depend on it. Everything in it follows from the sandbox alone:
 * take the gateway away and every line is still needed, which is why it is its
 * own package rather than more surface on `dsh-gateway-tunnel` (transport) or
 * on `dsh-tenant-account` (this deployment's tenants).
 *
 * ## Why `/files` and not `/api`
 *
 * The obvious home for these endpoints is the shared `/api` channel, through
 * `connection.rpc.intercept`. There is room for exactly one interceptor on it,
 * and dsh's own `typert-gateway` already holds it — a second registration
 * throws at mount, not at first call. So this takes a channel of its own, which
 * `connection.rpc.handle` exists for: same trust fence, same request envelope,
 * same body limit, and the nginx location and gateway forwarding rule it needs
 * are three lines in components this deployment already owns.
 *
