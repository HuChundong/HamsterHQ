     *   under a name was already in. Nearly everyone is on it, and a badge
     *   every account wears is decoration on every account rather than
     *   information about any of them. It is also exactly what this seat looked
     *   like before tiers existed, which is what makes the free tier arriving a
     *   non-event for the people already on it.
     * - **Pro.** The green a running sandbox wears, by its named token so a
     *   palette change is followed: dsh-brand leaves the state colours alone
     *   on purpose, so this is the one strong colour the window already has
     *   and the badge does not introduce a second.
     * - **Team.** The primary button's fill and its foreground — the ink-and-
     *   paper pair this file already presses into a filled button, which turns
     *   over with the theme because those tokens do.
     *
     * Pro is a tint rather than a fill for the reason the console's own tags
     * are: a colour mixed toward transparent survives both grounds, where a
     * fill has to be handed a foreground that reads on it in both, and there is
     * no token that promises one on top of a state colour.
     *
