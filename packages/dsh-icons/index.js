/**
 * One icon table, and the markup helper the surfaces outside the shell use.
 *
 * Which surfaces those are is the whole reason this package exists. Every
 * browser half of every plugin runs inside dsh and can ask the shell's module
 * table for `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`, which is the real icon set
 * — 70 React components. Those consumers import nothing from here except the
 * glyphs the harness has no drawing for.
 *
 * The gateway's pages and the landing page cannot do that. The gateway writes
 * HTML into template literals from Node, and the landing page is a static
 * document; neither has a module table, a React runtime, or a place to put a
 * component. What they can hold is path data, so that is what this hands them.
 *
 * The table is therefore two halves that are deliberately unlike each other:
 *
 * - `mirrored` is generated path data in `mirrored.js` by `mirror.mjs`,
 *   stamped with the harness version it was generated against. Never edited
 *   here — a fix goes through the generator.
 * - `extracted` is generated path data in `extracted.js` by `extract.mjs`,
 *   stamped with the lucide-static version it was generated from, for the
 *   glyphs the harness set does not carry. Also never edited here.
 *
 * Both halves are generated path data, not drawn by hand here, so they stay
 * on one grid and one construction. The extracted half is lucide-static: a
 * 24-grid stroke of 2/24 of its box against the harness's 1.3/16, stroked
 * rather than solid. The pages that read them have no module table.
 * Attribution is in NOTICE.
 *
 * `scripts/check-icons.mjs` holds both halves to their consumers, so an icon
 * changed here and not re-inlined — or inlined and not changed here — fails
 * before it is committed.

/**
 * One glyph as SVG markup.
 *
 * Each half is painted the way it was drawn, and the glyph says which it is.
 * The harness's are outlines already expanded to filled shapes, so they are
 * filled, `evenodd` leaving the middle of a ring open. Lucide's are strokes,
 * and filling a stroke turns a drawing into a blot — so a glyph carrying a
 * `stroke` is stroked, at the width it was drawn with, with its own caps and
 * joins. That roundness is the reason for taking them.
 *
 * No colour either way: every path is `currentColor`, so a glyph takes the ink
 * of whatever it sits in. `check-icons.mjs` holds both halves to that.
 *
 * Sizes are not converted. Lucide is drawn on a 24 box and the harness on a
 * 16, and a viewBox is a coordinate system rather than a size — both are
 * rendered at whatever edge the call site asks for. What has to match is the
 * WEIGHT of the line as a fraction of the box, and it does: 2/24 against
 * 1.3/16, two per cent apart. `extract.mjs` refuses a glyph that drifts.
 *
 * The result is a string rather than a node because both consumers are
 * assembling documents as text — Node writing a page, and a static file the
 * landing build parses.
 *
 * @param {string} name - a key of `icons`.
 * @param {{size?: number, className?: string, title?: string}} [options] - how to present it.
 * @returns {string} the `<svg>` element.
