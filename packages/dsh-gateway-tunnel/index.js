/**
 * The tunnel, as a plugin inside the dsh process it serves.
 *
 * It replaces a second Node process that sat beside dsh and reached it over
 * loopback. Two things came from that separation and go away with it: about
 * 40 MB of a second V8 heap per tenant, and — the one that actually cost
 * something — the guesswork about when dsh was ready. An outside process can
 * only probe, and it dialled the gateway too early twice: once before the
 * socket accepted connections, once before the API plane was mounted. The
 * gateway releases held browser requests the moment a tunnel appears, so both
 * reached a person. Injecting `connection` states most of that condition
 * instead of sampling it: the service exists only after
 * `dsh-client-connection` has mounted the `/api` route this forwards to.
 *
 * Not all of it, though. The two `/api/events.*` upgrade routes come from a
 * nested inject inside that same plugin, which nothing orders this after, so
 * the last step before dialling is still a probe — see `waitForDownlinks`.
 *
 * Requests still cross the loopback interface rather than being handed to the
 * route's handler in memory. dsh pins its configuration methods
 * (`settings.*`, `credentials.*`, `agentPreset.*`, `host.*`) to callers whose
 * `Host` is loopback, and the check lives inside the shared fetch handler, so
 * an in-memory call would have to construct the same request anyway — while
 * also reaching past the body limits and the route's own composition. One
 * loopback round trip buys behaviour identical to a browser's.

 * uses `ctx.setTimeout`, the redial after a dropped tunnel, threw where nothing
 * catches it and took the tenant's whole backend down with it. From outside
