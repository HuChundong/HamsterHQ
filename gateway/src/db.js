const SCHEMA = `
-- Who has an account.
--
-- \`id\` is what a tenant's durable state is named by, so it is generated here
-- and never derived from the address: an address deleted and registered again
-- has to be a different tenant, or it would inherit the previous holder's
-- files.
--
-- \`display_name\` and \`avatar\` are what a tenant calls themselves and what
-- they look like, both chosen by them and neither known until they have been
-- through the profile page. The avatar is a whole data: URI rather than bytes
-- and a type, because every reader of it puts it straight into an img element
-- and would otherwise have to reassemble one; it is bounded on write, and
-- there is no object store here to bound it. Null is the answer for an account
-- that has never set them, which is also what the shell's gate reads to decide
-- whether a tenant has been asked yet.
--
-- \`agreed_at\` and \`agreed_policy\` record which version of the policies this
-- account last agreed to, and when. Consent that is asked for and not written
-- down is consent nobody can show afterwards, which is the same as not having
-- asked. The version is the date stamped on the documents, so a row can be
-- compared against the text that was on the page rather than against whatever
-- it says today.
--
-- \`plan\` is which tier this account is on. The set of them is in plans.js;
-- this column is a text id and not an enum, so adding a tier is one line there
-- rather than a change here. Nothing in the gateway enforces a difference
-- between the tiers yet — this records what someone is on, and that is all.
--
-- \`model_key\` is the model credential this account holds, claimed once from
-- the pool below. On the account and not looked up through the pool on every
-- read, because this is a property of the tenant: which key is theirs is
-- decided at registration and never again, and everything after that is one
-- column of a row this deployment already reads to answer who the caller is.
-- Null for an account that registered when the pool was empty; those are
-- claimed by \`scripts/claim-model-keys.mjs\` once keys are loaded, which is a
-- thing an operator does knowingly rather than something that happens inside
-- somebody's sign-in.
--
-- (No backticks in here: this string is a template literal, and one would end
-- the schema early — which fails at boot, on the statement after it.)

-- somebody's tier changed — leave no other trace at all. settings carries an
-- updated_by, which says who touched it last and nothing about what it was
-- before or how many times.

-- the account; this table is then the record of which key went where, which is
-- what an operator needs when a key has to be revoked or explained. Nothing in
-- this deployment mints, prices or revokes them: a key is a string that works
-- until the thing that issued it says otherwise.
--
-- The key is the primary key because it is the thing that must not appear
-- twice — two rows carrying one credential would let two tenants spend one
-- allowance and each look correct. \`email\` is the claim, unique so that a
-- tenant holds exactly one, and NULL for a key nobody has taken yet, which is
-- what the claim searches for.
--
-- Not cascading from accounts, and this is deliberate: a key outlives the
-- account that held it, because the allowance it names was spent by somebody
-- and an issued credential is not made unissued by a row going away here. What
-- happens to it then is the operator's call — revoke it upstream, or leave it
-- claimed as a record of what was handed out.

-- Which sandbox belongs to whom, and where it is.
--
-- This was a Map in the gateway process, which made three things true that
-- should not be. A restart forgot every sandbox and reaped them all, so a
-- tenant who stayed signed in came back to an empty workspace — silent loss of
-- their history, where being signed out at least made the reset visible. A
-- second gateway would do the same to the first one's tenants on startup. And
-- two gateways could each start a sandbox for one tenant, mounting one volume
-- twice: two backends writing one settings file and one session log.
--
-- The username is the primary key because the rule is one sandbox per tenant,
-- and that rule belongs where it can be enforced rather than in whichever
-- process happens to be asking. Cascading from the account matters for the
-- same reason it does for secrets: a row that outlived its owner would hand
-- the next holder of that address a machine that is not theirs.
--
-- gateway_id is not read yet. It records which instance created the sandbox
-- and therefore holds its tunnel, which is what routing will need when there
-- is more than one instance; writing it now costs nothing and means the table
-- does not have to change then.
