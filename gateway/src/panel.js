/**
 * The right-hand panel's file plane.
 *
 * Reading a workspace and rearranging it: list a directory, describe one path,
 * hand back one file's bytes, and rename, delete or create one entry. They are answered here rather than in the sandbox because the panel's
 * data plane is envd, which the gateway addresses from outside through
 * CubeProxy — a plugin inside the sandbox would have to leave and come back.
 *
 * The security property is one line, and it is not in this file's path
 * handling: `callerOf` resolves who is asking and `sandboxes.ensure` hands
 * back THAT caller's own sandbox, so a request can only ever reach the machine
 * belonging to the tenant who made it. Cross-tenant reads are not defended
 * against here; they are unrepresentable.
 *
 * Inside one tenant's own sandbox there is nothing to defend. The sandbox is
 * the boundary, and within it the tenant is already root — their agent is a
 * root shell they type into. Anything the panel could be tricked into reading,
 * they can read by asking for it.
 *
 * So the workspace is the panel's SCOPE, not a fence: it is what makes this a
 * workspace browser rather than a filesystem browser, and it keeps paths
 * absolute and rooted. An earlier version also resolved every path through
 * `realpath` and re-checked the answer, to stop a symlink out of the
 * workspace. That bought nothing — the same read is a sentence to the agent
 * away — and cost a round trip on every request plus the wrong behaviour when
 * a tenant deliberately links their own directory into their workspace, which
 * should simply open.
 *
