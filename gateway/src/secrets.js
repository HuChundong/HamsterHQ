/**
 * Environment a tenant asks for in their own sandbox.
 *
 * The agent inside a sandbox reaches things — a database, an internal API, a
 * paid service — and reaching them needs a credential this deployment has no
 * business knowing about. There was nowhere to put one: the model credential is
 * the deployment's and lives in `settings`, and everything else a sandbox got
 * was decided by the gateway. This is the tenant's own half of that.
 *
 * Two rules make it safe to hand a tenant a lever on their sandbox's
 * environment, and both are enforced here rather than in the page:
 *
 * - **A name a tenant chooses can never be one the gateway sets.** The sandbox
 *   is told its own id, its dial-in token, and where to dial; a tenant who
 *   could set `SANDBOX_TOKEN` or `GATEWAY_TUNNEL_URL` could point their
 *   sandbox's tunnel at something else, or claim another one. `RESERVED` and
 *   the `MODEL_` prefix below refuse those names, and `sandboxes.js` composes
 *   the environment so that even a name that slipped through would be
 *   overwritten rather than win.
 * - **A value goes in and never comes back.** The page shows the name and when
 *   it changed, which is what somebody checking their own configuration needs;
 *   rendering the value would put it in a screenshot, a scroll-back, and
 *   whatever proxies the response, for a value its owner already has.
 *
 * @module secrets

/**
 * Names the gateway sets itself, which a tenant may not.
 *
 * The first three are the sandbox's identity and its way back to the gateway.
 * The rest describe the deployment's own model route: letting a tenant replace
 * the endpoint, the credential, or the name that ties them together would turn
 * their agent's traffic somewhere the deployment did not choose — and under
 * egress injection it would be pointing the deployment's credential at an
 * endpoint of the tenant's choosing, which is worse.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT reserved is any provider's own name. A tenant who
 * wants to spend their own DeepSeek key, or their own anything, sets it here
 * and configures that provider in their settings; nothing this deployment sets
 * collides with it, which is the whole reason the deployment's own route is
 * named for what it is rather than for whoever serves it.

 * `sandboxes.js` composes the deployment's values last, so a tenant's would
 * have been overwritten rather than honoured — but "a name a tenant chooses
