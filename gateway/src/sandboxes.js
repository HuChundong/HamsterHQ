/**
 * Per-user sandbox lifecycle.
 *
 * One user gets one sandbox, holding their sessions, their workspace, and the
 * agent that acts on both. Isolation between users is container isolation:
 * nothing in the gateway multiplexes two users into one dsh process, because
 * dsh has no tenant concept of its own — its `/api` surface is single-occupancy
 * and its session store is process-wide.
 *
 * Which runtime provides that machine — CubeSandbox, or the Docker simulation
 * — is chosen in `runtimes.js`. Nothing else here knows the difference: the
 * sandbox dials the gateway, so no code path depends on being able to reach in.
 *
 * WHO OWNS WHICH SANDBOX IS IN THE DATABASE, not in this process. The table is
 * the truth and the map below is this instance's cache of it, filled once at
 * startup and written through on every change.
 *
 * That distinction is the point rather than an implementation detail. Held only
 * in memory, the registry made a restart destroy every sandbox — a tenant whose
 * session outlived the gateway came back to an empty workspace, which is losing
 * their history silently. It also made a second gateway impossible: the first
 * thing a new instance did was reap every sandbox it did not know about, which
 * is all of another instance's. And two instances could each start a sandbox
 * for one tenant, mounting one volume twice.
 *
 * A row is claimed rather than recreated. `adopt()` at startup keeps what is
 * still running and clears what is not, so a sandbox that survived the gateway
 * is redialed and recognized — the sandbox client redials on its own.
