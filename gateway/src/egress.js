/**
 * What a sandbox may reach, and what gets added to its requests on the way out.
 *
 * Two things are decided here, both at sandbox creation and both enforced by
 * CubeSandbox rather than by anything inside the sandbox:
 *
 * - The gateway is reachable. CubeSandbox allows public egress by default but
 *   denies the private ranges alongside it, so that a sandbox cannot use its
 *   internet access to reach the infrastructure running it. The gateway sits on
 *   one of those ranges, so its address is allowed back in explicitly.
 *
 * - The model credential never enters the sandbox. The sandbox is handed a
 *   placeholder and CubeEgress replaces the `Authorization` header with the real
 *   key as the request passes through it. This matters because the agent inside
 *   runs with full access on the tenant's behalf: anything in its environment,
 *   its filesystem, or its process table is something a prompt can be made to
 *   read back. A key that is never there cannot be read back.
 *
 * The rule is scoped to the model host, which is also what keeps the
 * interception scoped: CubeVS routes traffic through CubeEgress only for hosts
 * a rule names, so everything else the agent reaches goes out directly and
 * unintercepted.

 * as what it is if it ever shows up in a log.
