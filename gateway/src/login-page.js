/**
 * The login page. Inlined rather than served from the web container because it
 * must work before any sandbox exists and must not depend on the frontend
 * bundle loading.
 *
 * It is the landing page's second screen and is dressed as one: the same
 * lattice ground running behind it, the same palette, the same faces, the same
 * capsule-and-pill vocabulary. Before that it was a white form on a white page
 * beside a black-and-grey one, and the seam showed the moment anyone crossed
 * it — someone who pressed "开始使用" arrived somewhere that looked like a
 * different deployment. Everything that decides how the two look now lives in
 * `page-chrome.js`, stated in the landing page's own numbers.
 *
 * The layout is still the product's own sign-in layout — centred wordmark over
 * a form column beside a panel — so the deployment does not hand its users a
 * second, unrelated visual identity before the app they are signing into. Where
 * the hosted product puts a scan-to-sign-in code, this puts the deployment's
 * WeChat account: signing in here is a mailed code rather than a scan, and the
 * panel is the one place on the page worth picking up a phone for.
 *
 * Where the hosted product puts terms of use, so does this: the consent line
 * above the button links the three documents and the box has to be ticked
 * before anything is sent. The durability warning that used to stand in their
 * place — sandboxes reclaimed when idle, reaped on every restart, nothing
 * backed up — is gone from the form and said in the terms being agreed to,
 * where it belongs now that there are terms. A form whose largest block of text
 * is a warning is a form people stop reading before they reach the button.
 *
 * It follows the visitor's system theme and offers a toggle over it. Dark is not
 * a darkened light: `--ink` is the accent as much as the ink — the button fill,
 * the focus ring — so it inverts, because a black button on a black page is not
 * a button.

  // the server has to, and the server refuses it again.

  // twice reads as a form that was not paying attention. What that missed is
  // WHERE the account is made: `accounts.admit(email, agree)` runs when the
  // code is answered, and it is that call that writes `agreed_at` and
  // `agreed_policy`. So the screen that records the agreement was the one
  // screen not showing it, and the only way to decline there was to abandon the
  // page. Consent that cannot be seen or withdrawn at the moment it is taken is
  // not being asked for, it is being assumed.
  //
  // Ticked only when what was agreed is what the page says now. `agreed` used
