/**
 * What this deployment promises, what it does with what you give it, and what
 * you may not do with the machine it hands you.
 *
 * Three documents, because they answer three different questions and a person
 * looking for one of them should not have to read the other two: the terms are
 * the deal, the data notice is what happens to what you type, and the safe-use
 * policy is what the sandbox may be pointed at. They are linked together, from
 * the sign-in page, and from the landing page's footer.
 *
 * Two things make this deployment's version of these documents shorter than a
 * commercial one, and both are stated rather than implied:
 *
 * - It runs no model. Everything a session says is forwarded to whichever
 *   provider the deployment's key belongs to, and that provider's policies are
 *   what govern the inference — so the safety rules that matter most here are
 *   upstream's, and this policy says so instead of restating them badly.
 * - It therefore has no use for tenant data. There is no training, no
 *   profiling, no analytics and no third-party script anywhere in it — the
 *   pages do not even fetch a font from another host — so the data notice can
 *   say plainly that nothing is used for anything, and then spend its length on
 *   the honest part: what nonetheless LEAVES this deployment, which is the
 *   model provider and the mail sender.
 *
 * The texts are the deployment's own statements about itself and have to stay
 * true of it: every claim below is one the code makes good on, and changing the
 * code without changing these is how a privacy notice becomes a lie. Where a
 * claim depends on the runtime — the model credential is withheld from the
 * sandbox under CubeSandbox and cannot be under plain Docker — it is written to
 * be true of both.
 *
