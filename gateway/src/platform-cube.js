/**
 * Starting, stopping and listing sandboxes, through CubeSandbox's own client.
 *
 * ## What "E2B compatible" turned out to mean
 *
 * This file used to hand-build `POST /sandboxes` and was named `e2b.js`, on
 * the belief that CubeSandbox's management API *is* E2B's and that pointing
 * the official E2B client at it was a matter of one environment variable.
 * That belief was wrong in a specific way worth writing down, because it is
 * the kind of thing a README's headline invites.
 *
 * CubeSandbox ships its own SDK — an independent implementation whose only
 * dependency is an HTTP dispatcher. What it offers is E2B's *surface*:
 * `Sandbox.create`, `sandbox.files`, `sandbox.commands`, the same names and
 * nearly the same arguments. Underneath it speaks CubeSandbox's own protocol
 * and converts on the way — `network.rules` given in E2B's host-keyed shape
 * becomes an ordered list of L7 rules, a volume map becomes a mount list.
 *
 * So the compatibility lives in the client, not on the wire. An application
 * holding the official E2B SDK does not get it: it sends E2B's shapes to an
 * API that does not take them. (CubeSandbox reads that as a bug against the
 * "drop-in" claim in its own README, and is fixing it — issue #1482.)
 *
 * ## Which client, then
 *
 * Each platform's own. Both SDKs expose the same surface, so the adapter
 * between them is thin, and each one is maintained by the people whose
 * protocol it speaks — which is the whole argument against the version of
 * this file that came before, where every shape CubeSandbox changed was a
 * shape this deployment had to notice by being broken.
