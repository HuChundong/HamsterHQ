 * console are different products to different people and still have to look

 *
 * The palette, the wordmark, the toast, and the theme toggle were written twice
 * before this existed, which is exactly as long as it took for a fix to land in
 * one of them and not the other.
 *
 * Everything here is a string. Both pages are server-rendered documents with no
 * build step — that is what lets them work when the frontend bundle has not
 * loaded and may be why it has not — so composition is concatenation.
 *
 * The icons come from `dsh-icons` for the same reason they do everywhere else:
 * these pages cannot ask the shell's module table for the harness's own set the
 * way a plugin can, because there is no shell here and nothing to hold a React
 * component. `svg()` hands back markup, which is the one thing concatenation
 * can use.
