/**
 * Deployment-wide configuration an administrator can change without a redeploy.
 *
 * Two things are stored, and they are the two that change while a deployment is
 * running: the model credential, and who is let in. Both were environment-only,
 * which meant rotating a leaked key or closing the door took an edit to a file
 * on the host followed by a restart — during which nobody could sign in — and
 * could only be done by whoever had shell access rather than by whoever
 * administers the deployment.
 *
 * The environment remains the fallback for both, so a deployment that has never
 * touched the console behaves exactly as it did before, and a database with no
 * row is a working deployment rather than a broken one.
 *
 * Every value is read at the moment it is used rather than cached at boot: a
 * sign-in reads the gate as it happens, and a sandbox reads the credential as it
 * is created. That is what makes the console's switches take effect on the next
 * request rather than on the next restart — the whole point of their being here
 * rather than in a compose file.
