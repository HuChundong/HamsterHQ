/**
 * The panel's terminal plane: one WebSocket per shell.
 *
 * A WebSocket rather than the request/response the rest of the panel uses,
 * because a terminal is the one surface here where both ends speak whenever
 * they like. Output arrives from envd as a stream and has to reach the browser
 * as it comes; keystrokes arrive from the browser between the frames.
 *
 * The asymmetry underneath is worth stating, because it is why this file is
 * short. Only envd's OUTPUT is a stream — `process.Process/Start` answers with
 * one — while input and resize are ordinary unary calls addressed by the
 * shell's pid. So there is no bidirectional stream to keep alive against
 * envd, and nothing here has to reconcile two directions of backpressure.
 *
 * The socket is the session. Closing it kills the shell, and losing the shell
 * closes it: a terminal that outlives the window it was typed into is a
 * process nobody can see and nobody can stop.
 *
