/**
 * The gateway: a backend for the session-bearing surface.
 *
 * nginx is the front door and serves the frontend from disk; it proxies here
 * only what needs a session or a sandbox. The frontend derives its API base and
 * its WebSocket URL from `location.origin`, so everything still has to arrive
 * on one origin — nginx's — which is why nothing here is addressed directly by
 * a browser.
 *
 * Routes:
 *   GET  /login          sign-in form
 *   POST /login          request a code, or answer one and sign in — see sign-in.js
 *   POST /logout         sign out and release the sandbox
 *   GET  /_auth          resolve a session for nginx's auth_request; status only
 *   GET  /whoami         the caller's address and profile, for the account section in Settings
 *   GET  /profile        the tenant's name and picture — see profile.js
 *   *    /secrets        the tenant's own sandbox environment — see secrets.js
 *   POST /sandbox/restart  throw this tenant's sandbox away; the next request rebuilds it
 *   POST /profile        set them, then into the application
 *   *    /api/*          authenticated; proxied into the caller's sandbox
 *   WS   /api/events.*   authenticated; bridged into the caller's sandbox
 *   WS   /_tunnel        sandbox dial-in
