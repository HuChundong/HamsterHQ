/**
 * The sandbox runtime seam.
 *
 * A runtime creates one isolated machine per tenant, hands it the identity it
 * needs to dial back, and reclaims it. That is the whole contract — the tunnel,
 * the gateway, and dsh's own configuration are unaffected by which one is in
 * use, because the sandbox connects outward rather than being connected to.
 *
 * Two exist. `cube` is CubeSandbox, the real runtime. `docker` is the
 * simulation that came first and remains the path a developer can run on a
 * laptop, where no CubeSandbox is installed.
