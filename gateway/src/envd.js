/**
 * Reaching into one tenant's sandbox: files, processes, terminals.
 *
 * Everything here goes through envd, the daemon every sandbox platform in this
 * family embeds, spoken by the official E2B client. This file holds the
 * addressing and the contract with callers: WHERE this deployment's sandboxes
 * are, and what those callers expect back.
 *
 * ## Where a sandbox is
 *
 * A sandbox has no address this host can route to, so the connection goes to
 * the proxy, which routes by PATH: `/sandbox/<id>/<port>/…`, prefix stripped
 * before forwarding. That is one of two routings the proxy offers, and it is
 * deliberately not the other one.
 *
 * The other is a virtual host — `<port>-<id>.<domain>` in a `Host` header —
 * which a standard fetch client cannot send: `Host` is a forbidden header,
 * silently dropped, so the proxy would answer for itself instead of for the
 * sandbox. This deployment therefore uses the proxy's path routing.
 *
 * Under `docker` there is no proxy and no routing to do: the container name is
 * an address on the network the gateway shares with it.
 *
 * ## What callers expect
 *
 * The signatures here are unchanged, and so is the way failure is reported:
 * `error.code === 'not_found'` is how a caller tells "there is no such file"
 * from "the sandbox is not answering", and `readFile` answers with a status
 * rather than throwing, because the panel turns it into an HTTP response. The
 * client's own errors are translated back into that vocabulary rather than
 * leaking outward — a change of client is not a change of contract.
