# DSH itself is installed from npm rather than built here. It is a dependency of

# and what a tenant runs is the `dsh` the registry publishes. Upgrading is a
# version bump plus the acceptance run.
#
# Stages:
#   deps     one npm install, shared by everything below
#   sandbox  one tenant's dsh, beside this project's three plugins
#   shell    boot the composition once and save what it serves
#   web      nginx over the frontend build and that shell
#   gateway  the authenticating front door; no harness code at all

# The harness version this deployment runs. A build argument rather than a
# lockfile entry, so a deployment can move between published versions without
# editing a file that also pins this project's own dependencies.

#
# Rust because of where this runs. A sandbox is one machine per tenant, so
# everything resident in it is paid for once per tenant — and what this
# replaced was `node -e '<script>'`, 21MB of resident memory and a second of
# start-up to poll a local HTTP endpoint every five seconds. This is a static
# binary with no dependencies: 1.5MB resident, and it starts in the time it
# takes to open a socket.
#
# Built natively, on the architecture it will run on. Each platform builds its
# own — the deployment is amd64 and builds there — so there is no
# cross-compilation to arrange and nothing to download: the native target's
# standard library is already in the image, the crate has no dependencies, and
# `--offline` states both rather than discovering them.
#
# Cross-compiling was tried and is worse for this. `rustup target add` fetches a
# standard library for the other target, which is a network round trip that
# takes longer than everything else here put together and is the one thing that
# can fail on a slow link.
#
# The binary is NOT run here. That check belongs in the `sandbox` stage, which
# is the image it will actually run in: a binary that cannot execute there is a

#
#   search and text     rg, fd, jq, less, tree, patch, file
#   fetch and archive    curl, unzip, zip, p7zip-full, zstd, xz-utils,

#   reachability         dnsutils, iputils-ping, iproute2, netcat-openbsd
#
# `make` because repositories are entered through it. `fontconfig` and
# `fonts-wqy-microhei` because a chart with CJK labels renders as boxes without
# them, and this deployment's tenants write Chinese. `libmagic1` and `libgomp1`
# are runtime dependencies of the wheels below, not tools in their own right.
#
# Measured while trimming, because two of these are not obvious: `libgl1` costs
# 41 packages and 49 MB of downloads for an OpenGL stack that nothing here uses
# — matplotlib draws through Agg — and `unar` costs 18 packages of GNUstep to
# read archives `bsdtar` already reads. Both are in the list this borrows from,
# for a runtime this one does not have.
#
# Still left out, and why: `wget` (curl covers it), `rsync` (nothing here copies
# between hosts), `openssh-client` (clones go over https), editors and `htop`
# (an agent edits through its tools, not through a TUI), `pandoc`, `ffmpeg` and
# `imagemagick` (each costs more than the conversions it would add), a compiler
# (every wheel below is prebuilt for this platform; a source build is the one
# thing a tenant has to install for itself), and database drivers (`pip` is

# particular business.
#

# `pyarrow` (152 MB, and duckdb reads and writes parquet in 58), `plotly`

# already draws), `zstandard` (23 MB for what the `zstd` binary above does to

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- landing ----
# Build the front door.
#
# `vite build`, which is the whole of it. There used to be a script here that
# copied the tree, hashed each asset and rewrote the references by string
# substitution; a bundler does that from the document it parsed, so it cannot
# leave a reference behind pointing at a name nothing serves.
#
# The names matter for one reason: an asset whose URL changes with its content
# can be cached forever, and one whose URL does not cannot be cached at all
# without going stale. Replacing a screenshot used to leave the old one on
# screen for an hour; now it is a different URL and arrives on the first load.
FROM node:24-alpine AS landing
# The repository's own shape, because the page names the gateway's marks by
# their real path — `../../gateway/assets/hamster.svg`. One file per mark in the
# tree, so a replacement reaches the front door and the sign-in page together,
# rather than a copy beside each page that shows one.

# Boot the composition once and save what it serves: index.html carrying the

#
# Derived from `sandbox`, and that is load-bearing. The composition adapts to
# its environment — a host with a native directory dialog composes
# `directory-picker-native` where a Linux container composes
# `directory-picker-browse`, and the bundle revisions differ too. Harvesting
# anywhere but the image the sandboxes run would ship a frontend whose plugin
# set does not match the backend it talks to.

# rather than by moving the profile, because these are the same directory: at
