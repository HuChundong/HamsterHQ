/**
 * Which of the two answers on the status stream has to be current.
 *
 * A subscriber is told two different kinds of thing at once. Whether the
 * sandbox is THERE is a fact this process holds — the tunnel registry knows
 * the moment one connects and the moment it goes. What it is DOING is a
 * measurement that has to travel, and is a few seconds old by the time it
 * lands. Only the first has to be current, and it must never be inferred from
 * the second: a report is evidence that a sandbox was alive when it was sent,
 * not that it is alive now.
 *
 * Driven against the module directly, with liveness under the caller's
 * control, because what is under test is which source each field comes from.
 * Through a deployment the two are hard to tell apart — a sandbox that is up
 * and reporting looks the same either way, and the cases that separate them
 * are the ones where reports and reality disagree.
