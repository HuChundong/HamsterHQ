/**
 * What the acceptance run uses to see into CubeSandbox sandboxes.
 *
 * Under the Docker simulation the acceptance run inspects sandboxes with the
 * Docker CLI, because they are containers on the host it runs from. A
 * CubeSandbox sandbox is a machine on Cube's own network: listing it is a
 * management-plane call and looking inside it is an envd call, and both need
 * credentials and a route that only the gateway container has. So this runs
 * there, and `verify.sh` calls it the way it calls `docker`.
 *
 * Verification-only. The gateway never executes anything inside a sandbox — the
 * sandbox dials out and that is the whole of their conversation — so this is
 * deliberately a separate entry rather than a method on the runtime seam.
 *
 * Copied into the gateway container and run as:
 *   node /app/verify-cube.mjs owners
 *   node /app/verify-cube.mjs ids
 *   node /app/verify-cube.mjs ids-of <owner>
 *   node /app/verify-cube.mjs exec <sandboxId> <shell command>
 *   node /app/verify-cube.mjs remove-all
