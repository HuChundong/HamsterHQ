/**
 * The one place this repository patches the harness, and the reason it does.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` says never to patch, vendor, or fork DSH, and every other change
 * in this repository obeys that. This one does not, so it states its case here
 * and fails the build rather than the deployment when it stops applying.
 *
 * ## What it changes
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-connection`'s browser half computes, once, at apply:
 *
 *     isLoopback: pageLocation === void 0 || isLoopbackHostname(pageLocation.hostname)
 *
 * and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-settings` binds every settings namespace with
 * `connection.isLoopback ? "host" : "memory"`. On `"memory"` a preference lives
 * in the tab and is discarded on reload, and reads report `unavailable`. So for
 * a browser on any hostname but `localhost`, `[::1]` or `127/8`, the entire
 * configuration plane is inert: theme, language, conversation preferences, the
 * shell's own settings. Every tenant of this deployment is such a browser.
 *
 * ## Why upstream is right, and why we are not upstream
 *
 * The lock is deliberate. The server pins `settings.*`, `credentials.*`,
 * `host.*` and `llm.discoverModels` to loopback callers even on a trusted-host
 * deployment, and says why: `trustedHosts` is a DNS-rebinding fence, explicitly
 * not authentication, so the configuration plane stays loopback-same-origin
 * *until a real authentication layer exists*. A LAN browser talking straight to
 * dsh genuinely must not reach that plane, and the client's `"memory"` fallback
 * correctly declines to try.
 *
 * This deployment is the authentication layer that comment is waiting for. The
 * gateway authenticates every request before it is forwarded, each tenant
 * reaches only their own sandbox, and the tunnel rewrites `Host` to a loopback
 * authority while stripping `Origin`, `Cookie` and the Fetch-Metadata headers —
 * so the server-side pin already passes, and has to: a browser on `localhost`
 * and a browser on a domain produce byte-identical requests by the time dsh
 * sees them, and the one on `localhost` persists its settings today.
 *
 * The client is therefore refusing to send something the server would accept,
 * on the strength of a hostname it reads out of its own address bar.
 *
 * ## Why it is patched here and not solved in a plugin
 *
 * Three plugin-shaped fixes were tried and each is closed:
 *
 * - **Configuration.** The browser half takes none. `trustedHosts` exists, but
 *   only the node half reads it; `apply(ctx)` has no config parameter.
 * - **Composition order.** `applyEntryPatches` can only *append* — without an
 *   id to the end of the root list, with one to the end of that group. A row
 *   this repository adds can never precede `ui-theme`.
 * - **Flipping the flag from a plugin.** The property is writable, but always
 *   too late: `ui-theme` has already constructed its controller by then, and
 *   `persistence` is fixed at construction.
 *
 * What remains inside the rules is an upstream change, which is not available.
 *
 * ## How this fails
 *
 * Loudly. An upgrade that renames or reshapes the expression makes this script
 * exit non-zero and the image build fail. A patch that matches nothing would
 * silently restore the original bug, so the build must fail rather than
 * continue.
 *
 * Usage: node web/patch-loopback.mjs <shell-directory>
