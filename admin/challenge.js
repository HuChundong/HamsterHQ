/**
 * The half-open door between the two steps of signing in.
 *
 * A password is checked first and a code second, the way every 2FA system
 * people already know works. Between the two the service has to remember that
 * somebody got the password right, and this is that memory: a signed token,
 * short-lived, that says nothing except "this caller cleared the first step".
 *
 * ## Why this is not just a flag on the session
 *
 * It is signed with the session key but carries a different audience, so a
 * challenge can never be presented as a session. The two are separate cookies
 * for the same reason — a bug that sent the wrong one somewhere would fail
 * closed rather than admit.
 *
 * ## Why it counts attempts
 *
 * Two-step sign-in introduces a risk one-step did not have. In one step, every
 * guess at the code also had to carry the password. In two, whoever cleared the
 * first step can sit on the second and try codes — and a code is six digits,
 * with three of them valid at any moment once drift is allowed.
 *
 * So a challenge is spent on success and burned after a few failures, and the
 * caller is sent back to the password. The per-address limiter in `auth.js`
 * still runs underneath this; the count here is what stops one password from
 * buying an unlimited number of guesses.
 *
