/**
 * The one page an operator sees before they are one.
 *
 * It wears the product's own sign-in clothes — the same ground, the same card
 * over it, the same fields and the same pill button as the page a tenant signs
 * in on. It was deliberately plain once, on the reasoning that an internal page
 * needs no design; what that actually produced was a second, unrelated-looking
 * product in front of the one thing that can change every account.
 *
 * What it does not borrow is the tenant page's content: no WeChat panel, no
 * policy links, no way to register. The wordmark is not a link either — behind
 * it is the console, which would only bounce a caller who is not signed in
 * back to here.
 *
 * Two steps, the same as the tenants' own sign-in and the same as every 2FA
 * flow an operator has already used elsewhere: the password, then the code.
 *
 * Still deliberately quiet about what is behind it. It names no deployment and
 * does not distinguish "no such user" from "wrong password" — with one account
 * there is nothing to enumerate and no reason to help.
 *

 * One sentence for a wrong username and a wrong password alike: with a single
