/**
 * The operator's session, which belongs to this service and no other.

 * Signed rather than stored, for the same reason the gateway's are: this
 * service should survive its own restart without turning every open console
 * into a sign-in page, and a session table is a table to keep.
 *
 * Its own secret, deliberately. Sharing the gateway's would mean a token
 * minted for a tenant and a token minted for an operator were signed by the
 * same key — which is the coupling this whole separation exists to remove,
 * and the kind that survives a refactor because nothing breaks when it is
 * there.
 *
 * Short-lived, with no refresh half. An operator signing in again after a few
 * hours is a small cost; a long-lived credential to a console that can rotate
 * the model key is not.
