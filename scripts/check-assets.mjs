/**
 * One rule about caching, in both directions.
 *
 * A name that carries its content's hash may be cached forever, because a
 * different file is a different URL. A name that does not must be revalidated,
 * because the same URL will one day hold different bytes. Everything else is a
 * bug with a delay on it: cache a fixed name for an hour and replacing the file
 * reaches some visitors now, some in an hour, and some not until they clear
 * something — and it will look correct to whoever deployed it, because their
 * own browser fetched it fresh.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened here. The mark went out content-hashed and
 * immutable from the landing page's build, and at a fixed name with an hour's
 * caching from the gateway and from nginx — the same file, cached two ways,
 * and which one a visitor got depended on which page they opened first.
 *
 * So this reads the places that set the policy and holds the rule from both
 * ends. It is deliberately not clever: what it can check is that nothing claims
 * to be immutable without a hash in the name it is served under, and that
 * nothing served under a name this deployment writes by hand is cached for a
 * period instead of revalidated.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-assets.mjs
