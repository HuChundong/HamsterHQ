/**
 * What the landing page has to hold true, checked without a browser.
 *
 * Less than there was. The page used to be one file that a script copied,
 * hashed and rewrote by string substitution, and most of what was asserted here
 * were the things that arrangement could get silently wrong: a reference the
 * substitution did not recognise, an asset staged into one of the three
 * assemblies and not the others, a mark opened from the checkout resolving to
 * nothing. `vite build` writes those references from the document it parsed, so
 * they are no longer claims to check.
 *
 * What is left is what a bundler has no opinion about:
 *
 * - The two languages cannot drift, because they sit on one line per string
 *   rather than in two files. That holds only while every key really does carry
 *   both, and while every string with markup in it goes through the attribute
 *   that renders markup — `data-t` sets textContent, so a `<code>` on that side
 *   reaches the reader as four visible characters.
 * - Links into the application are absolute and assets are not. Vite makes the
 *   asset URLs relative; nothing stops someone writing `/login` as `login`,
 *   which would be resolved against whichever root the page was served from.
 * - The deployment serves what the build produces, at the paths it produces
 *   them at, with the caching each deserves.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-landing.mjs
