/**
 * One icon set, held to its consumers.
 *
 * The interface a tenant sees is drawn by two things at once: the harness,
 * which ships 70 glyphs in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`, and this
 * repository, which adds four plugins, a gateway and a landing page around it.
 * Those used to be three different icon styles in one window — the harness's
 * filled 16-grid outlines, a second 24-grid stroked set, and a 16-grid set at
 * stroke 1.4 everywhere else — and three styles cannot sit in one window.
 *
 * So there is one set now, and it comes from the harness wherever the harness
 * has a drawing. What this checks is the three ways that can quietly stop being
 * true:
 *
 * - The mirrored half going stale. `packages/dsh-icons/mirrored.js` is
 *   generated from a pinned harness release; a `DSH_VERSION` bump that does not
 *   come back through `mirror.mjs` leaves this repository drawing an older
 *   version's glyphs beside the new one's.
 * - The copies drifting. Two plugin client halves are loaded raw by the shell's
 *   module loader and cannot import a sibling package, so they carry the path
 *   data inline. Nothing but this makes those bytes stay equal to the original.
 * - A surface going back to drawing its own. The gateway's pages and the
 *   landing page have a helper that hands them markup; a hand-written stroked
 *   `<svg>` beside it is how the second style got in last time.
 *
 * It needs only the tree — no network, no registry, no built image — so it runs
 * in the pre-commit hook with the rest.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-icons.mjs
