/**
 * What the panel's pure logic has to hold true, decided from the tree alone.
 *
 * Two things live here: the path scope, and the preview tickets. Neither needs
 * a deployment, and both are the kind of code where a case nobody produced is
 * a case nobody checked.
 *
 * It decides the panel's scope — a workspace browser rather than a filesystem
 * browser — and keeps every path absolute and rooted so the routes never
 * guess. It is pure string work with no I/O, so every case it exists for can
 * be produced here rather than hoped for in a deployment run: a traversal, a
 * sibling directory that shares a prefix, an encoded `..`, a null byte.
 *
 * Symlinks are out of its remit on purpose, and not because they are hard to
 * check: the sandbox is the security boundary, the tenant is root inside their
 * own, and a link they made into their own workspace should open rather than
 * be refused.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-panel-paths.mjs
